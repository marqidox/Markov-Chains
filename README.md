# Markov-Chains
This project integrates matrix operations in Python to calculate the long-term probability of pursuing economic mobility across generations given the parent's family income quintile.

I tracked 5 states: Bottom, Second, Middle, Fourth, and Top Quintile in a transition matrix and wrote a function to locate the equilibrium of the matrix based on a desired distance.
